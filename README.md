The **Iris Distant Horizons Installer** is a simple and user-friendly tool to install the [Distant Horizons - Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/distant-horizons-iris-shaders) modpack. This project simplifies the installation process, ensuring that Minecraft players can easily set up and enjoy the feeling of seeing further then 32 chunks.

### Hey you, yeah you! This information is important regarding memory allocation to Minecraft, so please take the time to read it.
Changing the amount of memory given to Minecraft is always a good idea, especially if using Distant Horizons, so here is the necessary info regarding it.
 * `2G` - No a good idea  - This will most likely crash your game, don't bother.
  * `4G` - Minimum - Things will stutter slightly, although anything below 256 chunks should be fine.
  * `6G` - Recommended - This is the optimum amount of RAM for Distant Horizons. This should be perfectly fine for playing with no to 20 light mods.
  * `10G` - Careful - This much RAM can sometimes be a bad thing for the Java Garbage Collector. Only use this if you are using a heavy terrain generation mod such as JJThunder To The Max or Big Globe.

`G` refers to `GB` or `Gigabytes` of RAM, we use the term `G` as that is what you must put inside memory allocation tab of the installer or else it will not work!

## Features
- Support for multiple Minecraft versions.
- Integration with [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) for fetching modpack updates.
- Sleek and modern graphical user interface (GUI).
- [Soon] Ability to choose a terrain mod upon install

## Installation
1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/UltimatePlayer97/iris-distant-horizons-installer/releases) page.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install the modpack.

### Requirements
1. An internet connection (should be common sense but might as well put it here)
2. A JRE (Java Runtime Envrionment) installed on your machine, if you do not have one installed get one from [here](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?packages=jre)

Note: if the JAR file does not open with Java (example WinRAR, 7zip or Notepad), you may use [Jarfix](https://johann.loefflmann.net/downloads/jarfix.exe) to fix the .jar association on Windows machines.
